# Prerequisites

This is a book written for the reseasrchers who want to learn how to use Snakemake to build repruducible and scalable workflows. We assume the readers have already been familiar with NGS data analysis. For example, a tipycal workflow of RNA-seq data includes quality control of the reads, read alignment, read count extraction, DEG detection, GO and KEGG enrichment analysis.
